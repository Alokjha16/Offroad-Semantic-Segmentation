# 🚜 Offroad Semantic Scene Segmentation  
### Ignitia Hackathon – Duality AI Falcon Dataset  

---

## 📌 Project Overview././././

This project focuses on training a robust semantic segmentation model for off-road autonomy using synthetic desert digital twin data provided by Duality AI.

The objective was to train on one desert environment and evaluate on a novel but similar unseen desert biome to test generalization.

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- Model: DeepLabV3+
- Encoder: ResNet101
- Framework: PyTorch + segmentation_models_pytorch
- Classes: 9 semantic categories
- Input Resolution: 320x320
- Optimizer: AdamW
- Scheduler: CosineAnnealingLR
- Loss Function: CrossEntropy + IoU monitoring

---

## 📊 Final Performance

Validation mIoU: **0.6204**

The model demonstrates strong generalization across unseen desert terrain scenes.
